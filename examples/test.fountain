EXT. MAST FARM - NIGHT[[Near Plattsmouth Nebraska.

Rivers nearby: Platte joins Missouri River]]

= Calm fields of wheat. Farmland. The heart of America.
= In darkness.
= Set location and time.

Wheat fields. Etched in darkness and moonlight. For the moment it’s calm.

**TITLE: Nebraska, 1875.**

A WOMAN CRIES OUT, drawing our attention to a scant farm house in the distance.

EXT. MAST HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

= Meet Walter and his son Henry.
= See Walter's scar = his wife Sarah passes while attempting childbirth.
= Seen through Henry's POV.

Perched on the house’s front stair is HENRY MAST. He’s 11 years old and anxious as anything. 

His mother’s intermittent screams emanate from the house.

Nearby his father WALTER MAST, 40’s, smokes a pipe. Keeps his back to his son. Trying to hide the worry in his weathered face.

More screams from inside.

HENRY
Was it like this with me?

Walter looks to Henry. His lack of response confirms it wasn’t. Something is wrong.

Then, silence.

Walter lowers his pipe. Faces the front door. Waiting. Standing in the painful silence.

He can’t take it anymore -- lunges forward -- bursts in the front door --

Henry strains to see past his father. 

His pregnant MOTHER lies motionless on the kitchen table.

A weary DOCTOR approaches Walter with trembling hands.

DOCTOR
I’m sorry, Walter.

He can barely pat Walter on the shoulder as he passes by.



Walter’s emotions overwhelm him. He folds in on himself, dropping to his knees before his dead wife.

Henry watches from the doorway. His eyes welling with tears.

!FADE IN:

EXT. MAST FARM - DAY

= Walter digs graves

Under grey skies. Walter hacks at the earth with a shovel. Stone-faced. Focused only on his task. Dig.

CUT TO:

.LATER

= Walter and Henry at the graves

Walter and Henry stand before a fresh grave bearing two wooden crosses. There are no words.

> FADE OUT:

INT. MAST HOUSE - WALTER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

= See Walter now. A drunk.

Sunrise spills through an open window. A soft breeze tickles the curtains.

Somewhere in the mess on the bed lies Walter. A farmer ought to be up by now. 

**TITLE: Eight months later**

HENRY (O.S.)
Pa!

Walter groans.

HENRY (O.S.)
Pa, we’re going to be late.

Walter swings his legs out of bed. An empty whiskey bottle falls to the floor. Not that he noticed.

Walter’s face hangs heavy. Tired. Unshaven.

EXT. MAST HOUSE - DAY

= The farm is falling apart. As is Walter.
= Henry is eager to go to church for some reason.

The fields look fallow. Henry drives their farm wagon, and their one horse, up to the front of the house.

Henry’s shirt is tucked in and his hair is combed. His version of Sunday’s best when you can’t afford more.

Walter exits the house, tucking his shirt in as he goes.

HENRY
Come on!

Walter climbs into the wagon at his own pace.

INT. MODEST FRONTIER CHURCH - DAY

= Meet Louis briefly, and his family - specifically daughter Mary, who it is very clear Henry likes.

The church is shoulder-to-shoulder as PARISHIONERS sing _All Creatures Of Our God And King_.[["All Creatures Of Our God And King" was modernized from an older hymn. This version wouldn't have been sung in 1875. It came to be sometime around 1900. Need to find a different song. One that fits chronologically.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSb1-9i-fDA

Reference:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canticle_of_the_Sun]]

Perched in the front pew and singing louder than anyone is LOUIS SUTTER, early 40’s. His opulent clothes hinting at arrogance. There’s no dirt under this man’s nails.

To Louis’s sides are his wife ELIZABETH, late 30’s, and daughters ANNA, 9, and MARY, 11.

Mary takes her eyes off her hymnal just long enough to catch Henry staring at her from another pew, a few rows back. 

Henry doesn’t look away. Just offers a soft smile that Mary returns.

Walter sings from the doorway with the same lack of enthusiasm he’s given the rest of the day.

EXT. MODEST FRONTIER CHURCH - DAY[[- shorter? 
- Walter's role in this scene? This is his first dialogue in the movie. Or should he even speak? It's page 4 before he says anything.]]

= After church Walter talks with Neighbor about Louis buying farms in the area.
= Create a feeling of dread for Louis.

Parishioners vacate the church. Walter chats with a group of fellow FARMERS.

GRIM FARMER
Heard he bought another one.

WOEFUL FARMER
Where?

GRIM FARMER
Sarpy county.

NEIGHBOR
Sarpy... He’s out to own the whole territory. Nebraska even.

WALTER
Man’s got means. What can you do?

NEIGHBOR
Tell you what I’d like to do--

Louis exits the church, glad-handing everyone as he goes.

NEIGHBOR
Look at that peacock. Like he’s president or something.

Louis passes by. His steely gaze locks with Walter’s.

NEIGHBOR
Be a cold day in hell before he gets my farm.

Walter can’t pull his uneasy eyes from Louis.

INT. SMALL TOWN BANK - DAY

= Walter is denied an extension on his farm's loan

Walter sits across the desk from a BANK OFFICIAL who can’t stop wringing his hands.

BANK OFFICIAL
I’d really like to help. I really would...

WALTER
I’m not asking for a hand-out, George. It’s been a tough season. I just need more time.

BANK OFFICIAL
You’ve already exceeded the grace period. Twice.

WALTER
I know--

BANK OFFICIAL
You’ve accrued penalties that frankly it doesn’t appear you’re capable of recompensing.

WALTER
I know--

BANK OFFICIAL
If you’re unable to make payment by month’s end you’re going to default on your mortgage and the bank will be forced to foreclose. Do you understand what I’m saying? We’ll take your farm, Walter.

This hits Walter hard.

EXT. MAST FARM - DAY

= Walter returns, can't find Henry.

Walter stops his wagon in front of the house. A moment passes as he take stock of his situation.

He grabs a whiskey bottle and knocks it back. Takes a long hard look at his farm.

WALTER
Henry!

No response.

WALTER
Boy!

Nothing. Where is he?

EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

= Get a sense for Mary as she and Henry share time.

A kite. Flying high over the prairie. Below there’s laughter.

Mary wrestles with the kite line. It’s windy enough that the kite keeps pulling at her hands.

She trades smiles with Henry.

-- a gust of wind grabs the kite -- jerks Mary to her toes --

Henry springs into action. Grabs her. 

Their weight too much, the kite line SNAPS and they fall to the ground in a heap.

They’re face-to-face. Smiles and awkwardness. If they were older this would be where they’d kiss. Instead --

-- they look to the sky. Mary’s kite floats away forever.

Suddenly Mary bursts out laughing and leaps to her feet. 

Henry watches her dance to music only she can hear. Gliding across the prairie without a care in the world. Henry smiles.

EXT. MAST HOUSE - SUNSET

= Show the strained relationship between Walter and Henry.

Henry approaches the house with a contented smile. Until he gets close enough to see --

Walter is on the porch. Smoking his pipe. On his way to drunk.

WALTER
Where you been?

HENRY
Out.

Henry blasts past him. Letting the door slam after him.

WALTER
You missed your chores!

Walter doesn’t go after him. Like always.

EXT. NEIGHBOR FARM - DAY

= Walter finds Neighbor packing up, moving on. Louis has bought his farm.
= A glimpse at Walter's future.
= Walter is indignant to his neighbor.

Walter’s wagon enters the long dusty lane to his neighbor’s farm. 

As he nears the house he spots an unexpected sight: Neighbor packing his wagon.

Neighbor is visibly upset.

WALTER
What’s going on here?

NEIGHBOR
I didn’t have a choice. 

Walter looks to the house where Louis is directing MEN. Walter realizes: Neighbor sold his farm.

NEIGHBOR
I got a family to think about.

WALTER
What did he offer?

NEIGHBOR
Enough. He offered enough.

WALTER[[remove the unused character name]]

Neighbor lifts his WIFE and TWO DAUGHTERS into the wagon. Then climbs in himself.

Walter is incensed. Betrayed.

WALTER
I never thought you’d be the sort to cut and run. Well go ahead. Scurry back to Kansas, you gutless cur. See if you can’t get work making womens’ dresses cuz you sure as hell ain’t no granger.

Neighbor takes the abuse. He couldn’t feel much worse anyway. 

NEIGHBOR
There’s nothing here for me. Nothing for you either. Time to move on.

Neighbor flicks the reigns. His wagon ambles off.

Walter can feel Louis’s eyes on him. Staring at him with fixed interest. Walter meets his gaze. Two titans of will in a silent stand-off.

EXT. MAST FARM - DAY

= Louis approaches

The sun blazes overhead. Walter is in the field, struggling to run a plow behind his horse.

Louis’s carriage rustles down the farm lane. 

EXT. MAST HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

= Louis offers Watler his best deal. Walter refuses.
= Louis opens up on him. About how unreasonable he is.
= He just can't understand him. How can he turn down a good deal?
= Maybe he's too drunk (soaked) to know a good deal.
= or
= He wouldn't know a good deal unless it was at the bottom of a bottle.

Louis climbs from his carriage just as Henry rounds the house and freezes -- stunned to see him.

LOUIS
Afternoon, son. Is your father here?

Henry doesn’t answer. Intimidated on every level.

LOUIS
I asked you a question. It’s impolite not to answer. That is unless you’re dumb. You’re not dumb, are you, boy?

Louis approaches Henry. Each step further illustrating how small Henry is to him.

WALTER (O.S.)
Go on inside, Henry.

Louis turns to see Walter only a few steps away.

WALTER
(to Henry)
Go on.

Henry runs inside.

LOUIS
Afternoon, Mr. Mast. My name is Louis--

WALTER
I know who you are. I’m not interested.

LOUIS
You haven’t heard my offer.

WALTER
I ain’t selling. Not now. Not ever.

LOUIS
Then I guess I made the trip out here for nothing.

Louis is still wearing his salesman’s smile. Walter’s not buying, and damn sure he ain’t selling.

LOUIS
Well be that as it may, I’m already here. I might as well unburden myself of my proposal. Twelve cents an acre would be more than a smart sprinkle but I can tell you’re a shaver and I don’t aim to waste your time. Thirteen cents.

Walter spits. Louis can’t believe it. He’s amused by a hard bargain.

LOUIS
Sakes you are a shaver. All right, Mr. Mast. You win. Best offer. Eighteen cents on the acre. That’s a right smart deal. Far more than it’s worth. Especially considering its current state. What say you to that, sir?

WALTER
Appreciate your offer, Mr. Sutter. The answer is no.

Walter turns, heads back toward the fields. 

Louis is beside himself with rage.
*This shouldn’t be here.*[[dialogue should have a character name above it. ]]

LOUIS
You turn your back on me?

Walter turns back, cautious of the tiger he’s uncaged.

Louis’s demeanor has flipped. The salesman’s smile has been replaced by a venomous rage.

LOUIS
I offered you a fair deal. _A fair deal._

WALTER
I meant no disrespect Mr. Sutter--

LOUIS
Money is respect! I offered you mine and you turned your back to me. You’re going to regret this.

Louis storms back to his carriage.

Walter looks uneasy. Sees Henry staring at him from the front door. 

INT. SMALL TOWN BANK - DAY

= Louis visits the bank
= Intent: buy Walter's loan

A satchel is dropped onto the Bank Official’s desk. The size and weight of which could hold a lot of money.

He looks up to see Louis wearing a devious smile.

LOUIS
Good afternoon.

EXT. MAST FARM - EVENING

= Bank official visits Walter, informs him his loan has been sold to Louis

Walter exits his house to find the Bank Official on his front door step with an apologetic nervousness.

Walter spots Louis a few yards away. Smirking.

WALTER
What are you doing here?

LOUIS
I’ve come for restitution.

WALTER
(to Bank Official)
What have you done?

BANK OFFICIAL
I’m sorry, Walter.

LOUIS
The bank was wise enough to sell me your loan. You see, they know a smart deal when they see one.

WALTER
You can’t do that.

BANK OFFICIAL
We didn’t have a choice. You’re over head and ears. Mr. Sutter paid in full.

LOUIS
Don’t worry, Walter, I’m not a hard hearted man. You have till the end of the week to square even. Which by my account is three months plus interest. Then it’s mine.

Walter looks he’s about to explode. Somewhere between tears and rage.

WALTER
(to Bank Official)
Please. My wife is buried in this land.

Shamefaced, Bank Official can’t even look at Walter.

LOUIS
You mean my land.

Walter’s torrid eyes peg Louis’s smug, haughty face so hard it could leave marks.

EXT. PRAIRIE - AFTERNOON

= More Henry and Mary alone time. Bonding. Provide a spark of hope for Henry to leave his father.

Henry and Mary trudge over the terrain in step.

HENRY
What’s school like?

MARY
I dunno. Fun I guess. My Daddy says anyone worth their salt has an education. You’ve never been?[[should be: don't know]]

HENRY
Pa won’t let me.

MARY
How come?

HENRY
He needs my help on the farm.

MARY
You aren’t there now.

HENRY
I hate that place. Besides, I’d rather be with you.

MARY
Maybe you could come live with us.

Henry looks rocked by the possibility. A meager jolt of hope.

EXT. CREEK - SUNSET

= Louis catches Mary with Henry. Tells him he can’t see her because his dad is a no good piece of trash.

Henry and Mary come to a small creek. Henry dashes across a fallen log to cross it.

Mary attempts to traverse the log but it’s unstable, wobbling  under her weight. She’s nervous and looks as if she’s going in the creek.

Suddenly Henry appears back on the log. He grabs her by the hand and leads her to the other side.

Once off the log Henry notices Mary doesn’t let go of his hand. He likes it.

They head toward her house, hand in hand. Each one stealing little glimpses and giggles at each other.

LOUIS (O.S.)
Let go of her!

Henry looks shocked. Sees Louis thundering toward them.

Louis shoves Henry away from Mary. Hard.

LOUIS
Don’t ever put hands on my daughter.
(to Mary)
You are never to see this boy again. Never! Do you understand?

Mary begins to tear up. She doesn’t understand.

MARY
But... why?

LOUIS
Because I said. Now get inside the house!

MARY
But Daddy--

LOUIS ^
I said get!

With tears in her eyes Mary runs to the house.

Louis turns his attention back to Henry.

LOUIS
Your father put you up to this?

HENRY
(confused)
No, sir.

LOUIS
Yeah, sure. He is a salty mop isn’t he?

HENRY
I’m not like him.

LOUIS
What do you possibly think you have to offer my daughter? You come from nothing. You are nothing. You are your father’s son. Don’t ever go near my daughter again.

Louis leaves Henry broken-hearted in the last bit of sunset. Darkness is coming.

INT. MAST HOUSE - NIGHT

= Walter is a mess. When Henry shows up he yells at him. Henry yells back. Animosity.

A cast iron skillet drops to the floor with a CLANG as the steak Walter was cooking in it falls out. Walter cries out, having burned himself by the fire.

He wraps his hand in a towel, muffling curses. He takes a swig from his whiskey bottle to help dull the pain.

Henry storms in.

WALTER
Get that steak off the floor will ya?

HENRY
(re: the whiskey)
Looks like you’ve already had dinner.[[Shaney 
Spooney
Corned
Tangled-footed ]]

WALTER
Watch the sass, boy. Where you been? I can never find you. I need your help around here. I’m trying to save the farm.

HENRY
You couldn’t even save ma.

Walter slaps Henry across the face. Immediately regretting it.

A tear rolls down Henry’s face but he doesn’t whimper. Instead he stares into Walter with contempt.

HENRY
I hate you.

Henry heads to his room. Walter is left hating himself.

INT. SUTTER HOUSE - LOUIS’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Louis reads over documents by lantern light. His wife Elizabeth fills the doorway.

ELIZABETH
She’s stopped crying... if you’re interested.

ELIZABETH[[this one should be removed]]
*This dialogue shouldn’t be here.*

Louis puts his paperwork down. Of course he’s interested.

INT. SUTTER HOUSE - MARY’S ROOM - NIGHT

= Show that Louis actually does care about his family. He's not a jerk for jerk's sake. Everything he does, even if they seem horrible, are to provide for and keep safe his family.
= Mary hugs him back. Showing he is worthy of love. Though we don't comletely see it. His daughter has obviously seen more from him than we have.

Louis peeks in. Mary’s on her bed, her back to the door. Louis crosses the room, sits gingerly on her bed. Takes his time finding the right words.

LOUIS
I’m only trying to do what’s best by you. Someday you’ll understand.

No response from Mary. Louis considers leaving for a beat.

Mary gets up, climbs into her father’s arms and hugs him tight. He hugs her back. Hard to say ‘I love you’ when you’re upset but it doesn’t mean you can’t show it.

= Walter visits Sarah’s grave. He's at his wit's end.
= A locust lands while he's talking to her. As if it's a sign.
(WALTER)

Abashed, Walter stands before his wife’s grave, wringing his hands.

WALTER
(softly)
I don’t know what to do. Sure could use your advice.

As if an answer -- 

A ROCKY MOUNTAIN LOCUST LANDS ON HIS WIFE’S GRAVE MARKER.
>Production note: grave marker is a weathered cross.<

Walter studies it, looking for meaning.

After a moment it flutters away.

INT. SUTTER HOUSE - DAY

= Mary discovers Henry is back

Mary combs through the hair of her doll. Suddenly there’s a PLINK of something against her window.

Mary goes to the window to investigate. 

Below: Henry, waves for her to come outside.

Mary’s face lights up when she sees him.

EXT. MAST FARM - DAY

= Walter in the field by himself. 
= His equipment breaks and his horse runs off. Horse damages Sarah's grave stone. (must setup grave earlier)
= He's at his breaking point.

A plow share chews up earth as it goes. [[should be removed]]

Walter’s in the field running it behind his horse.

Suddenly the horse stops.

WALTER
Come on.

Walter snaps the reigns but his horse doesn’t respond.

Frustrated Walter moves beside it. Smacks it on the butt. Nothing. He tries again -- slapping it so hard the horse rears up -- knocks Walter to the ground -- 

  The horse breaks from the field, dragging the plow behind.

Walter can only watch as it jangles and digs, puncturing his land in a Morse code of destruction.

WALTER
No!

The horse barrels right into his wife’s grave. Destroying the cross. Ripping soil like an open wound.

Walter clenches his jaw. Lets out a roar. He’s had enough...

EXT. SUTTER HOUSE - DAY

= Henry hatches a plan for him and Mary to escape
= Problem being Mary has it pretty good. She doesn't want to leave her family and her big house.
= His plan is crazy to her. She rejects him.

Henry and Mary hide behind a tree in her back yard.

HENRY
There’s a train tonight. Well have to go on the fly and hide in the cow crate so the bulls don’t get us. When we get to Lincoln we’ll find a flop. I’ll get work in a factory. You’ll have to work too.

Mary looks dismayed by his plan.

MARY
I don’t want to leave.

HENRY
It’s okay. I’m scared too. We’ll be fine.

MARY
That’s easy for you to say you’re not leaving anything behind.

Henry is stunned. She’s never insulted him before.

HENRY
It’s the only way we can be together.

Mary hesitates... can barely speak.

MARY
I don’t want to go.

Henry sinks back. Crestfallen.

INT. SUTTER HOUSE - SAME TIME

= Louis hunts for Mary

Louis scans the house.

LOUIS
Mary?

.BACK OUTSIDE WITH MARY AND HENRY

= Mary agrees to run away with Henry. 
= Louis catches them. Is about to lay the beat down on Henry when Walter shows up with a rifle.
= It's all about ot go down.
= ...and then come the LOCUSTS!

Henry grabs Mary’s hand.

HENRY
If I leave now you’re never going to see me again.

He waits for sign from Mary but she offers none. Can’t even meet his eyes. 

Defeated Henry stands. Instantly he’s yanked back down by Mary.

MARY
Okay.

Her eyes are heavy with sadness but at least they look at Henry. It’s enough.

Henry tends a soft smile. Happy she’s coming.

HENRY
Okay.

Henry rises just as a hand clamps down on him from behind -- throws him across the lawn.

LOUIS
What did I tell you? 

MARY
Daddy, no!

Henry tries to get up but Louis shoves him further across the lawn. Advancing faster than he can react.

LOUIS
What were the words I spoke?

Another shove.

LOUIS
If you’ve forgotten than perhaps I need to beat them into your memory.

Louis raises his fist to strike Henry.

LOUIS
Keep away from my--

CRACK! A SHOT rings out. 

Louis jolts as his shoulder dribbles blood, nipped by the bullet that just whizzed by him. A flesh wound.

Walter stands thirty yards away. Staring down the smoking barrel of his Winchester rifle.

His tone is measured and firm.

WALTER
Step away from my boy.

Mary screams. Runs in the house.

LOUIS
You shot me. You fuddled dolt.

Mouth agape, Henry scrutinizes Walter. Unsure if he fired a warning shot or if he’s so drunk he missed.

LOUIS
You’ll be in the calaboose by dinner. I’ll see to that. You’ve dug your own grave.

Walter cocks the lever on his rifle. 

Henry can see now: that was no warning shot. 

Louis sees it too. Finally as nervous as he should be.

LOUIS
Wait a minute now. Hold on...

Walter takes aim.

Suddenly Elizabeth emerges from the house with Louis’s rifle trained on Walter. Mary just behind her.

HENRY
No!

Walter sees her.

ELIZABETH
I’m a God fearing woman, mister, but if you don’t get that rifle off my husband I’ll bury you.

Eyes dart from side-to-side. Who will be the first to flinch?

Nobody moves. The air so thick with tension no one even breathes.

Walter refocuses on Louis. Resigned to whatever fate comes after. He fingers the trigger. Ready.

Suddenly a locust lands on Walter’s gun barrel.

Walter studies it. Perplexed.

Is it a sign from his wife?

Another locust zips by. Then another.

The sunlight dims on everyone -- as if a large cloud has moved overhead.

Then comes the noise: the strange, awful BUZZING. Growing louder with each second. Getting closer.

Everyone can feel it. Something’s not right.

Mary’s the first to look up. Her eyes going wide. Mouth agape.

MARY
Daddy...

Louis looks to the sky. The dread washing over his face too.

Finally Walter pries his focus from Louis. Gazes to the heavens.

The sky is alive in a swarm of locusts. Millions of them. Enough to block the sun, and every other inch of sky.

Walter lowers his rifle in sheer awe.

WALTER
My God.

Louis stumbles toward the house.

LOUIS
Inside! Everybody inside!

Everyone rushes for the house as the swarm descends at them.

INT./EXT. SUTTER HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

= Louis VS Walter at the front door. 
= He won't let them in!

Elizabeth pushes Mary inside. Louis pulls the screen door tight behind.

ELIZABETH
What are you doing?

Henry and Walter scramble for the porch. Swatting locusts as they go.

Henry gets to the door first. He jerks at the handle but Louis holds it fast.

HENRY
Let us in.

Henry jerks at the door to no avail.

MARY
Let him in.

ELIZABETH
Louis, please.

The locusts are everywhere now. Engulfing the landscape. The ground turning to a living carpet of hungry insects.

Walter finally makes it to the porch.

Louis lets go of the door -- grabs his rifle from Elizabeth -- raises it in time to meet Walter’s. Both men are face-to-face with each other’s guns.

Locusts crawl across Walter but he doesn’t flinch. This could be his chance to kill Louis.

HENRY
Mr. Sutter--

MARY
Daddy...

LOUIS
(to Walter)
You’re not getting in here with that rifle.

Walter stares into Louis’s cold eyes. 

He can hear Henry screaming, struggling to wipe the locusts clean. They need to get inside fast.
